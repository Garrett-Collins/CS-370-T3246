Pirate Intelligent Agent

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

Code I was given was to develop a Q-algorithm for reinforcement learning so that the pirate could find the quickest most efficient way to the treasure. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer science develop code as a tool to solve real world problems. This matters because the evolution of technology can save many things in this world. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Identify the problem, think abstractly on algorithms used to solve the problem. Then, develop the code and execute.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethical responsibilities is to respect user privacy, and ask for permissions to collect data. Also, program artificial intelligence unbiasedly.Ask yourself; Is there more benefits than problems with what I am developing?
